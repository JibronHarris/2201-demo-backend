Hey Guys, glad you were able to join me for this demo of Express and Sequelize :)

Feel free to fork and clone this repo! In it we overviews:

* How to start a node project
* How to add various middlewares
* How to set up Express and set up our initial routes ("Hello World")
* How to set up Sequelize and initially connect our database
* How to create Sequelize Models with different properties
* How to create Sequelize associations
* How to create Seed data (using sequelize)
* How to create a route that produces JSON based on our tables
* How to create a route that filters values from our tables

I apologize, I forgot to include an example of eager loading, but an example is present in the demo

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions :)
